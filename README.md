- A part of project associated between SSCF and NVSSN, Vital Signs project has a data pool and is trying to find a way to re-representing it. Since it's the current modular doesn't serve or maintain the high-level goal.
- Re-represented it in a modern way. That with ease to be interactively accessible by donors, volunteers, community foundations, community members, and stakeholders.

- That being said, it is requiring features or tools like an online interactive data source. Which is serving beneficiaries intuitively to realizing information by readerâ€™s eye, makes it easy to encourage reaction to action calls to impact community needs, dynamic data presentation, practical and useful way for staff to present data in future, and a module method for staff to manage data.
