## Notes from out customer regarding the lo-fi prototyping of the website design

### ***Focus on the following points:***
- main page (landing page)
	- to be presented in sections or blocks of sections. Each section is breifly showing information about website's features.
	- summaries and related information. To be designed as cards.
- adding stories and infographics.
- the possibility of exporting infographics and insights.
- searching and filtering. No more than 2 or 3 geographic regions are available right now with their information. That to be used in the map.

### ***Not to worry about:***
- current events and news. That is something out of the scope.
